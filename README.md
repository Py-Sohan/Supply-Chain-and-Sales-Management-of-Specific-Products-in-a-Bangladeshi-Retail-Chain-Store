# Supply Chain and Sales Management Analysis for a Bangladeshi Retail Chain Store

## Overview

This project analyzes supply chain and sales data from a specific Bangladeshi retail chain store. It utilizes data merging, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to derive insights into customer behavior, sales performance, product trends, store operations, and demand forecasting. The analysis covers overall performance, specific product deep-dives, and individual store analysis.

## Data Source

The analysis uses data from an Excel file named `case-study-data.xlsx`. This file contains multiple sheets representing different data dimensions:
* Fact_table
* Trans_dim
* Item_dim
* Customer_dim
* Time_dim
* Store_dim

## Analysis & Features

The project includes several analytical components:

1.  **Data Preparation:**
    * Loading data from Excel sheets using pandas.
    * Merging different data tables into a comprehensive dataset.
    * Data cleaning, including handling missing values using mode imputation.

2.  **Overall Analysis (`overall_analysis_code.pdf`):**
    * **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Calculation and identification of top customers based on CLV.
    * **Transaction Method Analysis:** Identifying the most popular payment methods (e.g., Bkash, specific banks).
    * **Revenue Prediction:** Using a Linear Regression model to predict total revenue based on store size, division, and quantity sold.
    * **New Store Opening Prediction:** Predicting the required quantity sold to achieve a target revenue for potential new store locations (store size and division).
    * **Demand Forecasting:** Forecasting quantity sold for the next 12 months using Exponential Smoothing.
    * **Revenue Forecasting:** Forecasting total revenue for the next 12 months using Exponential Smoothing.

4.  **Product Analysis (`product_analysis_code.pdf`):**
    * Focuses on specific items (e.g., 100177 and 100181).
    * **Sales Performance Analysis:** Calculating total sales, average sales, and total quantity sold for the selected items.
    * **Revenue Comparison:** Comparing total revenue generated by each specific item.
    * **Sales Trends:** Analyzing monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends.
    * **Performance by Store/Region:** Analyzing sales by store size and division.
    * **Customer Distribution:** Visualizing customer distribution by district.
    * **Store Performance:** Identifying best and worst-performing stores for these items.
    * **Prescriptive Analysis:** Using Linear Regression to predict sales and determine conditions (store size, division, item type, quantity) needed to achieve a target revenue.
    * **Demand/Revenue Forecasting:** Forecasting future demand and revenue for these items using Exponential Smoothing.

5.  **Store Analysis (`Store_Analysis_Code.pdf`):**
    * Focuses on a specific store (e.g., S0020).
    * **Store-Specific EDA:** Descriptive statistics and visualizations (price distribution, correlations).
    * **Revenue & Sales Trends:** Analyzing revenue by division, monthly, and yearly sales trends for the specific store.
    * **Customer & Transaction Analysis:** Customer distribution by district, popular transaction methods.
    * **Profitability Analysis:** Analyzing total revenue and profitability by item type.
    * **Customer Segmentation & CLV:** Segmenting customers (Low, Medium, High-Value) and calculating CLV for store customers.
    * **Predictive Modeling:** Using Linear Regression to predict total price based on item type, quantity, unit price, and quarter. Predicting revenue for specific scenarios (e.g., selling a certain item in a specific quarter).
    * **Sales/Revenue Forecasting:** Forecasting future sales quantity and revenue for the specific store using Exponential Smoothing.

## How Will It Serve Business?

This analysis provides valuable insights that can directly benefit the retail chain's business operations and strategy:

* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Empowers management with actionable insights derived from sales and supply chain data, moving beyond intuition.
* **Optimized Inventory Management:** Demand forecasting helps predict future sales, enabling better stock level management, reducing storage costs, and minimizing stockouts or overstocking situations.
* **Enhanced Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** Identifying high-value customers (via CLV) allows for targeted loyalty programs and personalized marketing efforts. Customer segmentation helps tailor promotions and improve customer retention.
* **Improved Sales & Marketing Strategies:** Understanding popular products, peak sales periods (monthly/quarterly trends), and effective transaction methods can guide marketing campaigns, promotions, and resource allocation.
* **Store Performance Optimization:** Comparing store performance (overall, specific stores, or by size/division) helps identify best practices and areas needing improvement or specific interventions.
* **Strategic Growth & Expansion:** Revenue prediction models based on store characteristics (like size and division) can inform decisions about opening new stores and estimating potential revenue.
* **Product Portfolio Management:** Analyzing sales trends and profitability by item type helps in making informed decisions about product assortment, pricing strategies, and supplier negotiations.
